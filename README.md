A CLI reservation system to demonstrate knowledge of OOP principles and database integration.
National Parks information is stored in a SQL database called campground. The user can view a list of available parks with a description of each. The user can then choose a park and view available campgrounds and information about the opening month, closing month and fee for the campground. The user can then search for date availability and make a reservation.
